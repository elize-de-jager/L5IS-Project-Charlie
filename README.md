Techtorium software dev level 5 project: Visitor Registration Desktop Application

Functionality:

The requirement is that visitors to the company must be able to register by means of entering some details about themselves and the meeting. The form should also enable user to record their meeting times as well.

Meeting with will be a dropdown. You can make use of your own fictitious names.

When selecting a meeting aim, make use of the custom dialog to provide the user with options. The meeting aim will then have to be displayed on the button. When the user cancel, no option will be selected on the main form.

All fields are required and apply the appropriate validations for the mobile number and email and once everything has been entered, the meeting info will be added to the In-Progress meetings list. The screen will reset to a blank state. Write a custom method to do this.

The receptionist will later be able to delete meetings once the visitor leaves. This is done by selecting an item in the list and pressing the DEL key on the keyboard.

Ensure you properly align all controls when placing them and follow the design provided.
